Independent Study Course

This independent study report consists of application-based research and practice of the fundamental concepts of neural networks and blockchain technology. This self-directed course will advance my knowledge of the core of a neural network, the mathematical model that powers it, and the use of languages to further develop its understanding.

The pursuit originated from an interest in blockchain technology not because it's a hot buzzword currently, but because my future employer, IBM, is a pioneer in building business solutions using the blockchain. This will serve as a prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants that IBM will test and scale to serve industry wide application to gain new insights resulting in better and faster decisions.
